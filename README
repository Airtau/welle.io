PLEASE READ

This directory contains the implementation of a simple
dab/dab+ receiver.
The receiver supports terrestrial DAB reception with as input either
the stream from a n AIRSPY, a SDRplay, a dabstick (direct
or through the rtl_tcp server) or a (prerecorded) file,
and it will output through the selected soundcard.


Building:

Libraries that are needed are

qt		(4.8 or more)	tested with both Qt4 and Qt5
usbx		(1.0.14 used)
portaudio	0.19		some distros support by default an older version
fftw3f
faad
sndfile

Two possibilities for building the software are there: the Qt qmake tools
or the CMake tools.

QMake:
In the ".pro" file  one may select (or deselect) input devices by
uncommenting (commenting) the appropriate CONFIG= XXX lines.

A similar facility exists for the CMakeLists.txt file

Note that selecting a device requires installing the library and the
development files.
