PLEASE READ

This directory contains the implementation of a simple
dab/dab+ receiver that will run on an RPI 2.
The receiver supports terrestrial DAB reception with as input either
the stream from a n AIRSPY, a SDRplay, a dabstick (direct
or through the rtl_tcp server) or a (prerecorded) file,
and it will output through the selected soundcard.

If configured - see ".pro" file or the CMakeLists.txt file -
the program will send its auio output to a tcp port.
A simple client is included - to be compiled and installed separately -
that can be used to map these PCI samples to a soundcard.

Building:

Libraries -and their development files - that are needed are

qt		(4.8 or more)	tested with both Qt4 and Qt5
usbx	use a recent version
portaudio	0.19		some distros support by default an older version
fftw3f
faad
sndfile

Two possibilities for building the software are there: the Qt qmake tools
or the CMake tools.

QMake:
In the ".pro" file  one may select (or deselect) input devices by
uncommenting (commenting) the appropriate CONFIG= XXX lines.

A similar facility exists for the CMakeLists.txt file

Note that selecting a device requires installing the library and the
development files.

Tested on RPI with arch linux, and RPI with Raspbian Jessie, as well as under fedora 22 and Ubuntu 14.04
Cross compiled for W7/W10

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Note that the CMakeLists.txt file assumes Qt5
